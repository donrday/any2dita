Markdown to HTML
================

[http://phpmaster.com/building-epub-with-php-and-markdown/](http://phpmaster.com/building-epub-with-php-and-markdown/)

Sample markdown content (to copy/paste as html for now:

* [http://kevinburke.bitbucket.org/markdowncss/sample.html](http://kevinburke.bitbucket.org/markdowncss/sample.html):
do a Ctrl-U to view source, copy, and paste into the HTML window. Look for the page's title in the expeDITA map list.

* [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax):
View source, copy from line 62 (or where &lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt; starts) and copy up to the end-of-article div (not including). Look for Overview in the Toc.

* [http://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/markdown_syntax/](http://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/markdown_syntax/):
Use as test content for the mid-to-dita transforms.
