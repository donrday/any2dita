Themes:
Themes provided with the expeDITA framework are based on "free css templates" that have been
adapted for the expeDITA theming system but respecting designer requirements for attribution
in the footers. In most cases, template providers allow a site owner to pay for the
removal of the designer attribution. Securing such extraordinary terms of use is the 
responsibility of users of themes provided in expeDITA. Or, write your own theme!
