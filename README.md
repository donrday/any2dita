# any2dita
PHP plugin for expeDITA toolkit that converts common doc formats into DITA.

`any2dita` is a plugin of the expeDITA toolkit that provides Web-based conversion into DITA from several popular formats: HTML, rich text (page copy/paste), Markdown, and Mediawiki. The page themes, behaviors, and DITA content rendering (this concept!) are powered by the expeDITA toolkit, which provides a plugin interface for third party extensions such as any2dita.

This initial version is a technology demonstrator, and initial documentation is sketchy. The most successful demos are from the extensive Markdown documentation itself at the daringfireball web site.

**Walk-through**

Click on the Markdown tab. On this tab you may either paste in/create your own Markdown content or use the URL field to directly get the text content of a Markdown site. We will use the URL option.

1. Copy the link text following "Endpoint example:" and paste it into the "URL" input field.
1. Submit the conversion request by clicking on the Proceed to migrate button.
1. Look below the conversion panels for messages about the conversion process.
